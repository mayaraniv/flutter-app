Answer / Flag: `MAZE{binARYcOdE}`

## Problem Statement

You've intercepted a scrambled message containing the following cryptic sequence: yunqOV]ZufmW{PqI

Your intel suggests this message follows the Capture the Flag (CTF) format. Careful analysis of the encoded message in conjunction with the CTF flag format will be crucial for deciphering the secret.

## Hint

Imagine manipulating the characters in a way that undoes the transformation.

## Solution

1. The problem's title hints at binary manipulation, pointing towards XOR as the likely cipher used for encryption.
2. The ciphertext is generated by XORing each character of the entire flag format with a fixed character key.
3. As hinted in the problem statement about analyzing the CTF flag format, the entire flag format is encoded.
4. Given the initial part of the flag as "MAZE," we can deduce the character key by XORing each character of "MAZE" with the corresponding character in the ciphertext. ('M' ^ 'y' gives 52 which is ASCII of '4')
5. XORing the character key ('4') with each letter of the ciphertext will reveal the flag.
