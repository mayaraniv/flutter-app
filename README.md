## Aim

RecipeRaven aims to develop a comprehensive recipe sharing platform where users can discover, share, and cook delicious recipes from around the world. With a focus on community engagement and culinary exploration, RecipeRaven offers a variety of features to enhance the cooking experience for users of all skill levels.

## Introduction

In this project, we aim to solve various challenges prevalent in the culinary domain. We strive to address the inefficiencies associated with traditional recipe management methods by providing a centralised platform for efficient organisation and accessibility of recipes. Our focus extends beyond conventional recipe sharing, introducing a dynamic, interactive experience with real-time, step-by-step guidance, voice recognition, and multimedia elements. Moreover, our goal is to consolidate the entire cooking experience into a seamless platform, reducing reliance on multiple devices/sources.

## Features 

### Dynamic Presentation Mode

- Introduce an innovative step-by-step card presentation mode, ensuring users seamlessly follow recipes. The system integrates timers for time-sensitive steps.

### Ingredient Clarity

- Display ingredients in various languages, including major Indian languages, and provide visual references.

### Smart Sorting and Filtering

- Explore recipes based on various parameters such as location of upload, food location, preparation time, cuisine type, meal category, caloric content, specific ingredients, and tags.

### Voice-Based Assistance

- Voice commands for searching and voice-based guidance while preparing dishes.

### Personal Cookbook

- Allows users to create a personal cookbook, organising and tracking their favourite recipes privately without sharing them publicly.

### User Interaction and Engagement

- Foster a sense of community by enabling users to like, comment, and rate recipes. Additionally, users can follow their favourite chefs.

### Top Recipes

### Bookmark and Save

- Empower users to save and bookmark recipes for future reference.
